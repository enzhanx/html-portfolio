<h2> My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3> The Avengers Part 1 & 2</h3>
<p>One of the best movies I've watched since I'm a super hero fanatic.</p>
<h3> The Hobbit (All parts)</h3>
<p>I love how the story goes and the races of the characters are the ones who I played in one of my favorite video games which is dota.</p>
<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>I just love the intense and hassle of the movie.</p>
